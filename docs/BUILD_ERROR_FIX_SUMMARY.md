# BuildError Fix Summary

## Root Cause
The BuildError was caused by multiple issues in the video-effects page:
1. Reference to undefined `sorted_video_models` variable
2. Call to undefined `calculateGenerationMP` function
3. CostDisplay component receiving undefined model prop
4. Missing safety checks for loading states and empty data

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Video Effects Page (`/src/app/tools/video-effects/page.tsx`)
- **Fixed undefined reference**: Changed `sorted_video_models` to `video_models` from the hook
- **Removed undefined function**: Replaced `calculateGenerationMP(model)` with `model.cost`
- **Added loading state**: Shows spinner while models are loading
- **Added empty state**: Shows warning if no video models available
- **Added safety check**: Wrapped CostDisplay in conditional to prevent undefined prop

### 2. CostDisplay Component (`/src/components/CostDisplay.tsx`)
- **Removed old imports**: Removed import of non-existent `calculateGenerationMP` function
- **Updated types**: Changed to accept new model structure with `cost` and `duration_options`
- **Fixed calculation**: Uses model's cost directly instead of calling missing function

### 3. Audio Page (`/src/app/tools/audio/page.tsx`)
- **Added model integration**: Uses `useAudioModels` hook to fetch models
- **Added model selection**: Shows dropdown to select audio model
- **Updated cost calculation**: Based on selected model's cost
- **Added model ID to params**: Includes model in TTS generation parameters

### 4. Voice Selection Panel (`/src/app/tools/audio/components/voice_selection_panel.tsx`)
- **Made flexible**: Accepts dynamic voice options via props
- **Fallback to defaults**: Uses VOICE_OPTIONS if no custom voices provided

## Database Status
- Video models ARE in the database (confirmed via API query)
- HunyuanVideo is active and set as default
- Models are correctly returned by the API

## Result
✅ Development server starts without errors
✅ No more BuildError in browser console
✅ All undefined references resolved
✅ Components handle loading and empty states properly

The tools now successfully integrate with the database models system.
