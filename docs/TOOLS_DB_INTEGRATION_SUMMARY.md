# Tools Database Integration Summary

## Problem Fixed
The BuildError was caused by:
1. Undefined `sorted_video_models` variable
2. Undefined `calculateGenerationMP` function  
3. References to old model types from generate_helpers

## Changes Made

### 1. Video Effects Tool (`/tools/video-effects`)
- Fixed undefined references by using `video_models` from the hook instead of `sorted_video_models`
- Replaced hardcoded model list with dynamic models from database
- Updated cost calculation to use model's `cost` property directly
- Fixed model selection dropdown to handle loading states
- Updated duration options to use model's `duration_options` array
- Fixed image-to-video detection to use `model_config.is_image_input`

### 2. Image Generator (`/tools/create`)
- Already updated to fetch models dynamically from database
- Uses `useEffect` to load models based on user plan
- Shows loading state while fetching models
- Automatically selects default model

### 3. Audio Tool (`/tools/audio`)
- Added `useAudioModels` hook to fetch audio models from database
- Added model selection dropdown before voice selection
- Made voice selection conditional based on model's `voice_presets`
- Updated cost calculation to use model's cost per 250 characters
- Made voice cloning conditional based on `supports_voice_cloning` flag
- Updated `VoiceSelectionPanel` to accept dynamic voice options
- Added model ID to TTS parameters

### 4. CostDisplay Component
- Removed dependency on old `calculateGenerationMP` function
- Updated to work with new model structure (`{ cost, duration_options }`)
- For video models, shows cost multiplied by duration

## Database Model Structure Used

```typescript
interface ModelFromAPI {
  id: string
  name: string
  cost: number // Cost in MP, already calculated with plan markup
  model_config?: {
    is_image_input?: boolean
    metadata?: {
      supports_embeddings?: boolean
      supports_styles?: boolean
      supports_voice_cloning?: boolean
      voice_presets?: string[]
    }
  }
  duration_options?: number[] // For video models
  supports_voice_cloning?: boolean // For audio models
  voice_presets?: string[] // For audio models
}
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Development server starts without BuildError
- ✅ All undefined references fixed
- ✅ Models load dynamically from API
- ✅ Cost calculations use database values

## Next Steps
1. Test the tools in the browser to ensure models load correctly
2. Verify that model selection persists and generates correctly
3. Update the API routes to use database models for generation
4. Test admin bypass for costs
